# Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains a collection of laboratory assignments, practical tasks, and a final project completed as part of the "Basics of Smart Technologies & Systems" course.

Key components include:

- Labs: Individual assignments covering fundamental and advanced ML algorithms.
- FastAPI Project: A demonstration of deploying a trained model as a RESTful API service.
- Notebooks: Supplementary files for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and experimentation.

## Quick Start and Setup

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cheporte/ml-nulp-course.git
cd ml-nulp-course
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`).

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate (Windows)
# .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
